Operators:
Operators are different symbols that we can use to perform operations like addition, subtractions, multplication, etc..
we can compare things if two entities are same or not if number is greater than the other number
There are 3 main types of operators.
1) Arithmetic operators
We use it to perform simple math operations
+ => Addition
- => Subtraction
/ => Division
* => Multiplication
% => Modulus , remainder

2) Relational operators
Are used to compare 2 quantities or entities. For example if something is bigger than other thing or if 2 numbers are
same or not or if 2 boolean variables contains same values or not
== => used to check if 2 variables contain the same value or not
!= => used to check if 2 variables are NOT equals or DON'T contain the same value
> => used to check if one value is greater than other value or not, if greater we get true
< => used to check if one value on the left is smaller than the value on the right side, if smaller we get true
>= => if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right side or if they are the same we will get true
<= => it's opposite of >= and it's used to check if something is less than or equal to the other
Conditional constructs
Used to write conditional code. A piece of code that executes based on a condition, if the condition is true Java
executes the code otherwise it skips that code
How to write IfElse condition:
if(condition){
any line of code even another if condition
}
3) Logical operators

Important Notes:
1) For String we use equals method instead of == sign because it's non primitives data type
2) We can ctrl+alt+l to format our codes
3) If we are confused about brackets we can click on opening or closing part to check the other part

If else conditions
When we have to test the same variable for multiple conditions I should use IF ELSE IF
When we I have multiple conditions and these conditions are dependent on each other Nested If condition
