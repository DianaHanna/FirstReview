What are Variables?
Variables are containers or boxes in the memory that can hold the data for us.

Why we need Variables?
Before we can ask the computer to do something for us, we need to store the information and instructions in a file
and we feed those to the computer and the computer does that thing for us.

How to create the Variables (Syntax)?
1) We need to tell the computer what type of box / container / variable we need.
2)  We need to give a name to the box.
